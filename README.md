# BeamNG .ter Terrain Import-Export Add-on for Blender  

This Blender add-on enables seamless import and export of BeamNG.drive .ter terrain files, allowing users to modify, refine, and create custom landscapes with greater flexibility. Designed for terrain editing and optimization, it bridges the gap between BeamNG.drive’s terrain system and Blender’s powerful 3D tools, providing a streamlined workflow for environmental customization.  

## Features  
- **Import BeamNG .ter files** into Blender for editing, transformation, and enhancement.  
- **Export custom terrains** back into BeamNG-compatible .ter format for seamless integration.  
- **Preserves terrain heightmaps**, textures, and key attributes for accurate rendering.  
- **Optimized workflow** for smooth terrain adjustments within Blender.  

## Installation  
1. Download the latest release from the repository.  
2. Open Blender and navigate to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.  
3. Click `Install` and select the downloaded add-on file.  
4. Enable the add-on and start importing/exporting .ter terrains!  

## Usage  
- Load existing BeamNG terrain files for modification.  
- Adjust terrain features using Blender’s sculpting and texturing tools.  
- Export edited terrains back into BeamNG.drive for testing and gameplay.  

## Warning and Recommendation  
It is highly recommended to create copies/backups of the original working progress files, so they won't get damaged/corrupted.  

## Contribution  
This project is open-source and welcomes contributions! Feel free to fork the repository, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements to enhance terrain integration between BeamNG.drive and Blender.
